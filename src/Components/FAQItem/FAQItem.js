  { question: "What is Machine Learning?", answer: "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming." },
  { question: "How is AI used in everyday life?", answer: "AI is used in various ways, including virtual assistants like Siri, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, and chatbots." },
  { question: "What are neural networks?", answer: "Neural networks are a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates." },
  { question: "What is Deep Learning?", answer: "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers to analyze complex patterns in data." },
  { question: "What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?", answer: "NLP is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and respond to human language." },
  { question: "How does AI impact job automation?", answer: "AI can automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more complex and creative tasks, but it may also replace some jobs." },
